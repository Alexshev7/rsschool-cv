### Briefly About Myself:
I started my career in technical support. I didn't stop and started learning HTML and CSS. Now I work as a content manager in an online store. I often use HTML and CSS in my work. I like to turn the product description into HTML code. But I want more, so now I'm studying at RS School. I am sure that JavaScript will open up a lot of new and interesting things for me in creating layout and web applications.
